# Analysis-on-bikers-number
This is the project from my master's Statistics course.

Sliced and visualized the collected data (1966 rows ) of riders at a particular spot. Calculated the statistic values and made an assumption about the distribution of female bikers. Used moment estimate method to estimate its parameters and chi-square test is carried to test the assumption's accuracy.
